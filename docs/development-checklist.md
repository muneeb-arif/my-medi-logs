# Development Priority Checklist – My Medi Logs

> Plan type: **Option A – 3 Phases (MVP → v1.0 → v2.0)**  
> Audience: You (solo dev) + any future dev/design help.  
> Goal: Ship useful value fast, keep scope under control, and evolve towards the full SRS.

## Phase 1 – MVP (Foundations + Core Patient App)

**Goal:** A fully working patient app for a single user managing self + family, with core records, basic security, and no doctors/AI yet.  
**Target:** First real users in Pakistan, no external doctors portal.

### 1. Environment & Project Setup

- [ ] Create Expo + TypeScript project.
- [ ] Add base dependencies:
  - [ ] React Navigation (stack + tabs)
  - [ ] React Query
  - [ ] Zustand
  - [ ] React Hook Form + Zod
  - [ ] HTTP client (axios or fetch wrapper)
- [ ] Configure `tsconfig` paths (`@features`, `@components`, `@theme`, etc.).
- [ ] Add ESLint + Prettier and run once to clean code.
- [ ] Add `.env` handling for dev/staging/prod.

### 2. Theme, Layout & Shared Components

- [ ] Implement theme system based on `theme/` docs:
  - [ ] colors.ts
  - [ ] typography.ts
  - [ ] spacing.ts
  - [ ] radius.ts
- [ ] Build base layout components:
  - [ ] `Screen` (SafeArea + ScrollView / FlatList wrapper)
  - [ ] `AppBar` (title + back/action icons)
  - [ ] `SectionHeader`
- [ ] Build generic UI components:
  - [ ] `Button`, `IconButton`
  - [ ] `Card`
  - [ ] `Avatar`
  - [ ] `TagPill` / `Chip`
  - [ ] `EmptyState`
  - [ ] `ListItem`
  - [ ] `ToggleRow`

### 3. Navigation Skeleton

- [ ] Implement `RootNavigator`:
  - [ ] Auth stack (Login/Register/Forgot)
  - [ ] Main tabs (Home, Profiles, Reports, Notifications, Settings)
- [ ] Implement per-tab stacks:

  - [ ] Implement `/account/me`.
- Frontend:
  - [ ] `auth.service.ts` using `apiClient`.
  - [ ] `session.store.ts` (tokens, active account).

    - [ ] `MedicalProfileScreen` (view profile summary).
  - [ ] UI flows:
    - [ ] Switch active profile.
    - [ ] Delete profile with confirmation modal.
  - [ ] Respect per-profile flags:
    - [ ] `emergencyAccessEnabled` toggle in editor (UI only for now).

### 6. Reports (Basic)

_No doctors, sharing, or fancy filters yet. Just upload & view._

## Phase 3 – v2.0 (Advanced: Doctors, Sharing, AI, Family Tree)

**Goal:** Extend app towards full vision: doctor onboarding, share links, early AI, and family risk features.  
This phase can be split further later; treat it as a roadmap bucket.

### 1. Doctor Onboarding (Minimal)

- Backend:
  - [ ] `Doctor` accounts with login/register (separate auth space).
  - [ ] Permissions: doctor can only view profiles they have consent for.
- Frontend (patient side):
  - [ ] Doctor directory (even if manually seeded initially).
  - [ ] Ability to search/select a doctor when creating consent.
- Frontend (doctor side – can be web or minimal mobile early on):
  - [ ] Simple interface to:
    - [ ] view shared profiles
    - [ ] upload reports
    - [ ] add visit notes.

### 2. Share Links & QR

- Backend:
  - [ ] `POST /profiles/{id}/share-links` for temporary access tokens.
  - [ ] Landing endpoint `/share/{token}` that:
    - [ ] verifies token & expiration
    - [ ] returns limited view data.
- Frontend:
  - [ ] UI to create share link with scope + expiry.
  - [ ] QR generation view.
  - [ ] Integration with native share sheet (WhatsApp, email, etc.).
- Security:
  - [ ] Each token use logged in AccessLog.
  - [ ] Tokens short-lived by default.

### 3. Family Tree & Relations (Base)

- Backend:
  - [ ] `FamilyRelation` model per `domain-model.md`.
  - [ ] Endpoints to:
    - [ ] define relationship between profiles.
    - [ ] retrieve simple family graph per account.
- Frontend:
  - [ ] UI for linking family profiles (parent/child/sibling).
  - [ ] Basic visual summary (doesn’t have to be a full-blown graph yet).

### 4. AI Foundations (Optional but Strategically Important)

- Backend:
  - [ ] `AiSession` and `AiMessage` models.
  - [ ] `/ai/sessions` and `/ai/sessions/{id}/messages` endpoints.
  - [ ] Integration with external LLM provider, with:
    - [ ] de-identification step
    - [ ] safe prompt templates.
- Frontend:
  - [ ] “Ask My Medi Logs” or “Health Assistant” tab:
    - [ ] Basic chat UI.
    - [ ] Restrict to explanation and summarization of existing data.
- Safety:
  - [ ] Prominent disclaimer about not being a doctor.
  - [ ] No direct treatment or medication changes suggested by AI.

### 5. Insurance & Claims (Enhanced)

- Backend:
  - [ ] Add `InsurancePolicy` + optional `InsuranceClaim`.
- Frontend:
  - [ ] Insurance section with card storage and notes.
  - [ ] (Later) simple claim log.

### 6. Monetization Hooks

- [ ] In-code feature flags for:
  - [ ] Pro / free differentiators (storage limit, AI usage, condition profiles limit).
- [ ] Simple local enforcement (no payment processing yet).
- [ ] Prepare architecture for Stripe/Braintree or platform IAP later.

### 7. Security & Compliance Hardening (Phase 3)

- [ ] Encrypt sensitive columns at rest where supported (backend).
- [ ] Ensure full audit logging for doctor usage and share links.
- [ ] Prepare HIPAA/GDPR checklist for potential US/EU rollout.
- [ ] Evaluate migration path from low-cost infra to AWS HIPAA-ready if traction increases.

### 8. Testing & Hardening

- [ ] Expand integration tests for:
  - [ ] share links.
  - [ ] doctor view vs consent permissions.
  - [ ] family relations retrieval.
- [ ] Conduct basic security review (SQL injection, IDOR, insecure direct object access, etc.).

**v2.0 Completion Criteria:**

- App is used by:
  - [ ] real patients & families.
  - [ ] some pilot doctors.
- Patients can:
  - [ ] share condition-specific info securely.
- Doctors can:
  - [ ] access shared profiles & upload notes.
- Optional AI:
  - [ ] provides safe, clearly-labeled explanations and summaries.

## How to Use This Checklist

- Treat **Phase 1** as *non-negotiable foundation*. Don’t pull Phase 3 items into Phase 1.  
- Keep a simple tracker (Notion, ClickUp, or GitHub Projects) and paste this checklist as your master plan.  
- Before each coding session, pick **1–3 items** only. Don’t context-switch across phases.

You can refine this document as you learn from users and as the product evolves.
