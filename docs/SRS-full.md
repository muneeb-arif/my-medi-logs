# My Medi Logs – Comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (Full)

> This is the **full SRS** for the My Medi Logs mobile application.  
> It combines functional requirements, non‑functional requirements, architecture, security, compliance, and future roadmap into a single reference.

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the complete set of requirements and high‑level architecture for the **My Medi Logs** application – a patient‑centric health records app for managing personal and family medical data, sharing it securely with doctors, and enabling future AI‑based assistance.

This document is intended for:

- Product owner / founder  
- Designers & engineers  
- Security & compliance reviewers  
- Potential partners (clinics, hospitals, insurers)

### 1.2 Scope

My Medi Logs is a **mobile application (iOS & Android)** built with **React Native (Expo)** and a cloud backend. It allows:

- Individuals to manage their own and family members’ health records.
- Patients to store and view lab reports, prescriptions, vitals, medications, surgeries, insurance, and doctor information.
- Users to present a concise **Emergency profile** in critical situations.
- Patients to share selected data with doctors using consents, secure links, and QR codes.
- In future, AI modules to summarize history, explain reports, and assist with mental health and risk prediction.

The system initially targets users in **Pakistan** but is designed to be **HIPAA/GDPR‑ready** for future global expansion.

## 8. Compliance & Legal

- Designed to be HIPAA/GDPR‑ready:
  - Right to access → export summaries.
  - Right to erasure → account/profile deletion.
  - Consent tracking → ConsentGrant & AccessLog tables.

## 9. Roadmap Alignment

This SRS is aligned with the phased roadmap:

1. MVP patient app.
2. Doctor access & consents.
3. Condition profiles & family tree.
4. AI assistants.
5. Integrations and enterprise partnerships.
