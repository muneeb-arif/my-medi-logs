# Architecture – My Medi Logs

## 1. Architectural Style
- **Mobile App (Expo) with TypeScript**
- **Backend (REST API)** running on Supabase/AWS hybrid
- **Feature-based modular architecture**
- **Cloud object storage for reports**
- **React Query for data lifecycle**
- **Zustand for UI/session state**
- **API + Consent-driven authorization model**
- Future-ready for HIPAA/GDPR compliance.

   - Consent rules
   - Access scope
3. Backend retrieves/enriches data.
4. Backend returns secure response.
5. App caches with React Query.

  - profiles
  - medical data
  - audit logs
  - consent records

### 4.2 File Storage
- Cloudflare R2 / AWS S3
- Strict private buckets
- Signed URLs for temporary access

### 4.3 Caching
- React Query caching on client
- Optional Redis on backend (future for AI/doctor search)

---

## 5. Security
- End-to-end HTTPS
- Signed URLs for file access
- JWT access + refresh tokens
- Consent-based authorization
- Access logs for every sensitive action
- No PHI in logs, notifications, or error messages
