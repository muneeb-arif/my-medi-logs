# AI Psychologist Spec (v2+) – My Medi Logs

This document defines requirements for an AI-based psychologist / mental wellness assistant. This feature is high risk and must be implemented with strict safety guardrails.

## 1. Purpose

Provide mental wellness support through:
- Journaling prompts
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-style reflection questions
- Stress management techniques (breathing, mindfulness, sleep hygiene)
- Emotional check-ins and mood tracking insights

The AI is **not a therapist** and must not:
- diagnose mental health conditions
- provide trauma therapy
- replace licensed professional care
- handle emergencies with anything other than urgent referral guidance

## 2. Feature Scope

### 2.1 MVP Use Cases

1. **Mood Check-in**
   - “How are you feeling today?”
   - mood selection + text reflection

2. **Journaling Prompts**
   - prompts by theme: anxiety, stress, burnout, grief, self-esteem

3. **CBT Reflection**
   - identify thought → emotion → behavior
   - reframe thought prompts

4. **Self-care Recommendations**
   - non-medical suggestions:
     - breathing exercises
     - journaling
     - hydration/sleep reminders
     - walk/stretch suggestions

5. **Progress Summary**
   - weekly summary of moods (not medical diagnosis)
   - highlight patterns:
     - “You felt more stressed on weekdays.”

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope / Not Allowed

- diagnosing conditions (depression, PTSD, etc.)

- encourage contacting trusted person

### 3.2 Medical Referral Rules
