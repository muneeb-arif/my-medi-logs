## 5. Constraints & Assumptions

- The mobile app will be built using Expo + React Native.
- Internet connectivity is required for core operations (no offline full PHI storage in v1).
- Initial deployment will target a non‑HIPAA cloud but design is HIPAA/GDPR capable.
- External AI services, if used, will be integrated in later phases and not required for MVP.
